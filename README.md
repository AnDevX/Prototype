# Prototype
[2D archetype]

This is a public repo, a sandbox, a template of a simple 2D game, will keep adding basic common features. 
I hope you are able to branch and contribute to this. 
I would like this to be a way to introduce new people into indie dev gaming and development.

HowTo:
Create a branch to contribute and raise a pull request to master.
